 Raspberry Pi to make a rest endpoint for Home Automation Commands and the programming will be done in Python. 
 <br/>
  By way of hardware I'm going to show you how to control a lamp using X10 brand devices. I choose the Pi because its small form factor and affordable price make it an ideal candidate for your Home Automation Controller 
  <br/>
  
   I choose the X10 brand for the hardware because it's been around the longest and tends to be the least expensive and making it a good choice for new Home Automation enthusiasts. And finally, I choose Python because it is the lingua franca of the Pi and the language of the X10 driver that I'll be using and also a perfectly good language for building a <b>RAS Server(Remote Access Server</b>.
