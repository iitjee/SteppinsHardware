 Raspberry Pi to make a RESR endpoint for Home Automation Commands and the programming will be done in Python. 
 <br/>
  By way of hardware I'm going to show you how to control a lamp using X10 brand devices.
  
 <br/>
  
   I choose the X10 brand for the hardware because it's been around the longest and tends to be the least expensive and making it a good choice for new Home Automation enthusiasts. (X10 is a protocol similar to bluetooth)
   And finally, I choose Python because it is the lingua franca of the Pi and the language of the X10 driver that I'll be using and also a perfectly good language for building a <b>RAS Server(Remote Access Server)</b>.

<br/>
  Basically, X10 is used this way. There's an adapter kind of thing and a plug-converter type of thing. You connect X10
adapter to you R Pie and install the driver. Then you send the command from R pi to adapter which in turn sends to the 
connecter one, and the appliance which is physicaly plugged into the connecter instead of the socket will be controlled.
   <br/>
   
You might also want to get a HDMI to VGA or to DVI adapter, if you plan to plug the Pi into a monitor while you work with it, assuming your monitor doesn't have an HDMI port. The Pi's only video output is HDMI. 
For all equipment, wat "What to order to follow along"
