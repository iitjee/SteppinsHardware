We'll be focusing on both the older Raspberry Pi B and the new Raspberry Pi, model B+, for the purposes of this course
We'll be using Raspbian OS with VNC server already installed so that it will launch at boot up.
make sure that we've got SSH and our localization set up properly.

(With Jessie it's very simple. You just go down to Preferences, you go to Raspberry Pi configuration. 
What you're going to do is go to Interfaces. For SSH, you're going to enable it just by clicking here and localization 
you can just click here and go to Time Zone, and under Time Zone pick whatever time zone you happen to be in.
As soon as you do and say okay, you're ready to go. It's a lot easier than using sudo Raspi-config and it's done. It's very
important that you have your time zone set properly or the hour, minute, seconds that you're going to get will not make sense.)
 If you don't set your localization, it'll set you up at Greenwich Mean Time which is what you don't want to have as your default.
 
 
 
Required:
A power relay, 
a power bar,
motion detector, and
a Pi cam.


Overview of  the alarm project:
- There are six basic features for your Raspberry Pi alarm system:
video streaming,
wireless motion detector, 
solid state relay, 
alarm picture storage by DATE, 
free remote access to your Pi alarm from anywhere in the world, and free SMS to your cell phone.

Video streaming, you can use it as a baby monitor while you're in your home using your local area network. 
When you're outside your home you can use the wide area network and use it as a Nanny cam. 

Wireless motion detector allows you placement of your Raspberry Pi system anywhere that you have access to WiFi, that means
in any room, office, anywhere that you have WiFi you have access to your Raspberry Pi alarm system.

Solid state relay allows you to turn on your lights when motion is detected, 
and this can be regular lighting if you want to use the Pi camera, or
if you want to use night vision, you can use infrared lights for your Pi NoIR camera. 

 Alarm picture storage by DATE, when the alarm is triggered, you can store pictures based on the date that they were taken. 
 You have free remote access to your Pi alarm from anywhere in the world using a free system called www.Developer.weaved.com 
 allows you free access to VNC, SSH, and WebIOPi, and VNC allows you remote control with screen sharing.
 
 SSH we're going to be using a little differently. We're going to be using it with FTP to allow you to transfer file, picture 
 directories from your Raspberry Pi to any remote computer anywhere in the world, and if you wish, you can also use FTP to
 transfers files from a remote computer to your Raspberry Pi. 
 
  We're going to be using WebIOPi to turn on and off your security system through any browser on any cell phone, tablet, 
  or computer system. To top it all off, we have the ability to send ourselves free SMS messages to your cell phone 
  when the alarm triggers using a free service called www.textbelt.com
