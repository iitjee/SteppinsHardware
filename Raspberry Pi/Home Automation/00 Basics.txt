We'll be focusing on both the older Raspberry Pi B and the new Raspberry Pi, model B+, for the purposes of this course
We'll be using Raspbian OS with VNC server already installed so that it will launch at boot up.
make sure that we've got SSH and our localization set up properly.

(With Jessie it's very simple. You just go down to Preferences, you go to Raspberry Pi configuration. 
What you're going to do is go to Interfaces. For SSH, you're going to enable it just by clicking here and localization 
you can just click here and go to Time Zone, and under Time Zone pick whatever time zone you happen to be in.
As soon as you do and say okay, you're ready to go. It's a lot easier than using sudo Raspi-config and it's done. It's very
important that you have your time zone set properly or the hour, minute, seconds that you're going to get will not make sense.)
 If you don't set your localization, it'll set you up at Greenwich Mean Time which is what you don't want to have as your default.
 
 
 
Required:
A power relay, 
a power bar,
motion detector, and
a Pi cam.


Overview of  the alarm project:
- There are six basic features for your Raspberry Pi alarm system:
video streaming,
wireless motion detector, 
solid state relay, 
alarm picture storage by DATE, 
free remote access to your Pi alarm from anywhere in the world, and free SMS to your cell phone.

Video streaming, you can use it as a baby monitor while you're in your home using your local area network. 
When you're outside your home you can use the wide area network and use it as a Nanny cam. 

Wireless motion detector allows you placement of your Raspberry Pi system anywhere that you have access to WiFi, that means
in any room, office, anywhere that you have WiFi you have access to your Raspberry Pi alarm system.

Solid state relay allows you to turn on your lights when motion is detected, 
and this can be regular lighting if you want to use the Pi camera, or
if you want to use night vision, you can use infrared lights for your Pi NoIR camera. 

 Alarm picture storage by DATE, when the alarm is triggered, you can store pictures based on the date that they were taken. 
 You have free remote access to your Pi alarm from anywhere in the world using a free system called www.Developer.weaved.com 
 allows you free access to VNC, SSH, and WebIOPi, and VNC allows you remote control with screen sharing.
 
 SSH we're going to be using a little differently. We're going to be using it with FTP to allow you to transfer file, picture 
 directories from your Raspberry Pi to any remote computer anywhere in the world, and if you wish, you can also use FTP to
 transfers files from a remote computer to your Raspberry Pi. 
 
  We're going to be using WebIOPi to turn on and off your security system through any browser on any cell phone, tablet, 
  or computer system. To top it all off, we have the ability to send ourselves free SMS messages to your cell phone 
  when the alarm triggers using a free service called www.textbelt.com
  
  
  POWER SUPPLY:
You'll want to be sure to get a 5 to 5.4 volt micro USB connector and 1.2 to 2.5 amps. In this case, bigger is better.
Phone chargers work, but be sure to get a good one. Some cheaper chargers don't deliver the voltage or amperage that they say
that they will.( the voltage will drop to 4.8 volts or less when the current draw is two amps. This may cause the Raspberry Pi 
to reset since the voltage is too low to properly keep the Pi running.)
(Notably, the Wi-Fi connector will draw a lot of current. The wire gauge should be at least 20 gauge to safely carry two amps.
 The lower the wire gauge number, the greater the amount of current it can carry. Some cheap power supplies can have 30 gauge
 wire that will melt if you try to put two amps through it)
 
 Select a USB Wi-Fi adapter:
  Communicating with your Raspberry Pi using an Ethernet connector means that you have to have it located close to your router.
 Wi-Fi adapter allows you to place your Raspberry Pi wherever you can receive Wi-Fi signals. Depending on the strength of the
 signals from your wireless router will determine if you need a Wi-Fi dongle with or without an antenna. You want to get a Wi-
Fi connector that works right away without having to find specialized drivers if they exist at all. Make sure it has out-of-
the-box support for Raspbian Wheezy or the latest, Raspbian Jessie. 
When your Raspberry Pi is a long distance from your router or if later you will be putting your Raspberry Pi 
into an enclosure, you may need an antenna.
Make sure your Wi-Fi dongle has the same protocol as your wireless router.
  
 Select a Raspberry Pi camera:
 - The Raspberry Pi Camera will be used to do video streaming as well as taking pictures of people that enter your home. 
You'll be able to stream video to any web-based systems, such as a smart phone, personal computer, tablet etc.
- The maximum picture resolution will be 5 megapixels but you can choose other resolutions such as 640x480 or 320x240 etc.
 through software. 
- There are three different cameras that can be connected to your Raspberry Pi's custom CSI bus and each has
 a maximum resolution of 5 megapixels.
- The Raspberry Pi Camera is used for shooting in normal lighting conditions and has a short ribbon cable. The Raspberry Pi No
 Infrared or NoIR Camera is the same as a Pi Camera board but has NoIR, in other words No Infrared filter. It's used for night
 vision use and you need to have an extra source of infrared illumination and it's not good for normal lighting conditions and
 again, it has a short ribbon cable. The spy camera is used for shooting in normal lighting conditions, it's much smaller than
 the Pi camera board and it's easier to conceal and it does come with an 11.4 inch cable.
- Now, if you do need extra cables for the Raspberry Pi Camera or the Pi NoIR Camera, the Pi Camera and Pi NoIR Cameras come with short default cables but they can be replaced by longer cables and here are your choices, eight inch, 12 inch, 18 inch and 24
 inch.

Select a camera mount or enclosure:
- Raspberry Pi camera cables are very flexible and can flop around and do damage to the camera if not secured. To secure the
 camera, you can either get a camera mount or camera enclosure. These are required by both the Pi camera and Pi NoIR camera.
 However, because the spy cam's small size, it can easily be stuck to just about any surface. Cheapest solution for the Pi
 camera boards is the camera mount. The camera enclosure is more expensive but might give you a more finished look to your
 project.

Select a Pi Cobbler:
- The Pi Cobbler is a small printed circuit board that plugs easily into a standard breadboard.
 There are two types of Pi Cobbler, 
    - a 26-pin version that works with older Raspberry Pis that have 26-pin GPIOs or general purpose input output and
    - a 40-pin version which works with the newer Raspberry Pis that have 40-pin GPIOs. 
Even if you have a newer Raspberry Pi that has 40 GPIO pins, we will be using a 26-pin Pi Cobbler. We can get a reduction cable that goes from the 40 GPIO pins to the 26-pin Pi Cobbler.

Then we will simply connect the 26-pin Cobbler to the reduction cable. 
There are a couple of reasons for using the 26-pin Pi Cobbler. 
 - The first is that the 40-pin Pi Cobbler takes up a lot of room
 on your breadboard.
 - The second reason is that after experimenting with things hooked up to your breadboard, we will eventually want to have a printed circuit board version of your design. 

Later we will use a 26-pin connector to a good quality printed circuit board to make our design more secure. 
The following items are sold exclusively from adafruit.com, and might be used in the follow-up video.
So, no need to concern yourselves with these at this point.


Select a breadboard:
- The breadboard that you select should not be too big or too small. If it's too small, then you might not have enough room to
 connect up what you need for experimentation. If you choose a breadboard that is too big, then it becomes expensive, and you
 may only use a portion of it, and the rest will be wasted. For the purposes of this video, I'm going to suggest the following
 breadboard. It's not too small, and will allow you to not only hook up things that are required by this video, but will also
 allow you to hook up other things that you may wish to experiment with.
