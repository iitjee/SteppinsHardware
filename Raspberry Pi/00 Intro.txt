The easiest way to transfer files to your Raspberry Pi is with a flash drive. Copy it to your drive from pc
and connect it your Pi by  inserting it into one of the USB ports and it will show up on your desktop. It'll ask you 
if you want to open it up in the file manager, which is exactly what we want to do, and you'll notice that the flash
drive shows up under /media, FLASH DRIVE.

(is a clearinghouse of information about the version of Linux running on Raspberry Pi)
(There is information about the General Purpose Input/Output pins, also known as GPIO, Raspbian Wheezy, a version of
Linux designed for the Raspberry Pi, and some sample projects. You'll also find information about other embedded systems
such as the MinnowBoard and BeagleBoard. Adafruit sells the Raspberry Pi as well as power supplies, motor control boards
and experimentation kits.)

sells electronic kits as well as the Raspberry Pi and peripherals.
If you're buying odd electronic parts or even normal electronics parts, SparkFun is a great place to look.

Safety Handling:
The Raspberry Pi is a circuit board. It's not protected and is fragile compared to a normal desktop computer. Be sure to
ground yourself to remove static electricity. You can do this simply by touching a metal surface. 
**Don't place the Raspberry  Pi on metal surfaces.** 
If you lay it on a metal surface, there is a good chance you may short out some of the electronics 
underneath or on top of the board. Be careful with the pins and the electronic components on the board. They are fragile and
will snap off, and they're often mishandled.

**Be especially careful when plugging and unplugging the power, USB, and other connectors and be especially careful not to
short out those gold GPIO pins on the very back of the board.**
You may want to build or buy a case to protect your investment.
Do a quick web search for Raspberry Pi enclosures, and you'll discover an entire community dedicated to creating weird and
wonderful custom boxes for these little computers. If you're fortunate, you may have access to a 3D printer.

Understanding the Pi Family! :)
When you first decide to purchase a Raspberry Pi, you'll find it confusing array of Raspberry Pi versions. In reality the're only a couple of features to consider. 
1. Availability:
2. Onboard memory (Early model As only had 256 megabytes of on board memory. The Raspberry Pi 3 now has four times that amount.)

One of the advantages of the Raspberry Pi, over other micro controllers, is it's built in Ethernet port. 
(if you're buying a used Raspberry Pi model A or A plus, you wont get Ethernet on those two models.)

Speed din't used to a factor, since all Raspberry Pi were sensely the same. However the Raspberry Pi model 3 has increased the
clock spin with four Cores running at 1.2 gigahertz. For some applications this may make a difference.

A recent change, only present on a Raspberry Pi model 3 is the addition of built in wireless and Bluetooth support. 
In the past both of these could be accomplished but required a USB adapter.

At this time I recommend the Raspberry Pi model 3 for general experimentation. It's fast, reasonably priced, the GPIO is easy
to access, and the board has wireless and Bluetooth built in.

Accessories:
- Power
- SDCable
- Ethernet
- Kbd and mouse
- HDMI cable
- monitor
(all are easy to obtain, also available in 2nd hand stores)
