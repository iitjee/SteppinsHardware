/* Catch phrases for demonstration  */
Let there be light!


Why React?
- One of the benefits of React is that it handles state very elegantly. React makes it a bit easier for us to build large
 applications that deal with a lot of changing data. Combining React components with web sockets provides a graceful way to 
share real time data between the server and many clients.

Why DocumentDb?
The two most important factors when choosing a NoSQL database are scalability and performance. Which is why DocumentDB is such an exciting solution. DocumentDB scales exceptionally well and is fully managed, making our job as a developer much more stream line.

Amazon claims that just an extra 1/10 of a second on their response times will cost them one percent in sales. And Google 
claims that half a second increase in latency, which is just 500 milliseconds, causes their traffic to drop by a fifth. And 
that's a few billion dollars. There are psychological studies that indicate that a user starts getting impatient if the web 
request on the screen takes more than just 200 milliseconds, which is really nothing more than a fifth of a second.
Competitive advantage in today's online world is about 250 milliseconds. If your website is faster than the competitor's 
website by just 250 milliseconds on average, you might have already won the game.

 DocumentDB is a fully managed, noSQL database service built for fast and predictable performance. High available, elastic 
 scaling, global distribution and ease of development. As a schema-free noSQL database, DocumentDB provides rich and familiar 
 SQL query capabilities. Yes, you heard me right, SQL query capabilities. This is the best part. DocumentDB guarantees that 99% of your reads are served under 10 milliseconds and 99% of your writes are served under 15 milliseconds.
