 Breadboards have a ground rail intended to provide ground access to any circuit.

These are often identified with a negative. Breadboards also have power rails next to the ground rails, one on each side. Sometimes there are two often used voltages in a circuit. The Raspberry Pi for example uses 3.3 volts and five volts. You may find it convenient to run a ground jumper from one side to the other. If all power rails are the same, then you could also run a power jumper as well.
