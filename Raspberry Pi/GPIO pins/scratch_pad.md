Models A and B => 26 pins (located next to RCA video jack)
Models A+ and B+ and 2 => 40 pins
Model 3 => 40 pins with slight difference

On all of these models, the GPIO pins are easy to identify. An interesting thing to remember about the 40-pin GPIO connectors is that they are the same 26-pins on the low end as the Model A and B. The Raspberry Pi Model 3 also has 40 pins, although the board looks slightly different. 
Significantly different is the Model Zero. The Model Zero also has a 40-pin set up, but the pins are not populated, there are no wires coming out of the holes, and if you want to use a Raspberry Pi Model Zero, you'll need to insert your own wires and solder them in place.

- The Raspberry Pi can be programmed in many different languages. C++, Java, Mathematica, Ruby, Lua, Smalltalk, and more
- Python and scratch most common (installed as part of the Raspbian)

 breadboards have a ground rail intended to provide ground access to any circuit.

These are often identified with a negative. Breadboards also have power rails next to the ground rails, one on each side. Sometimes there are two often used voltages in a circuit. The Raspberry Pi for example uses 3.3 volts and five volts. You may find it convenient to run a ground jumper from one side to the other. If all power rails are the same, then you could also run a power jumper as well.
